## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For me this was a deep dive into the world of CSS-Grid. I built this challenge with almost only Grid layout. Some of the new things I learned and applied are subgrids, full bleed layout for the hero section pictures. There were many challenges, that led me into a deeper understanding of Grid layouts. My usual resources that I used to find the solutions are listed below.
